Notice:
- find duplicate nodes by serilization of node information,use map to store serilization, if frequency == 2, add to res list
- frequency cannot set to >= 2 which will add one same node to res list multiple times
- collect return int will make algorithm faster
- t is a id, every new serial will get a id with increment 1
